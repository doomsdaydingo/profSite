				<h2> Welcome </h2>
				<p>My name is Ethan A. Pinsker and this is my web page. If we've met before, thank you for taking the time to learn about my professional passions. Else, if this is how I'm meeting you, I hope you are inspired by what inspires me!</p>

				<h2>Current Work</h2>
				<p>Since January 2017 I have been employed by Bay Area Environmental Research Institute, to be a researcher for NASA Ames Research Center, Earth Science Division. The group I do research for at NASA is called the Airborne Science Program. In addition to my research, my responsibilities include:</p>
				<h4>Iridium modem integration for NASA Airborne Science Data and Telemetry System</h4>
				<p>I am currently working with another engineer on our team to construct and test the next generation of a science instrument that utilizes iridium sat-phone modems for navigation data recording. I have hardware and software tasks for this instrument. Following a schematic and enclosure I had to construct the instrument so the modems and other essential parts would logistically fit.  addition to crimping. As for the software I use AT commands in Minicom to configure and troubleshoot the modems on this instrument. I love this kind of work because I am participating in a new innovation for airborne science.</p>
				<h4>Board design in Altium Designer (put in links to download library files)</h4>
				<p>Sometimes following a schematic other times using my own designs, I place components on the board and route their nets so they can be fabricated through a vendor. I also test all of the boards that we receive from vendors. Some boards I route have hundreds of components or require components that are not in any Altium Library. If I can not find the schematic symbol or footprint for a part, I have to make my own. Use these links if you want to download and take a look at some of the #symbols# and #footprints# I have made. Routing and solving the best way to place components on a board is fulfilling to me when I see the finished physical product that I fabricated.</p>
				<h4>Lead Firmware Designer (needs link to previous work)</h4>
				<p>I design the firmware for our ARM7 TDMI microcontrollers that we use on multiple instruments. These microcontrollers use RS-422 serial communication with the instrument they operate on. C is one of my favorite languages to code in, if you want see previous work I have done in C, you should check out my #previous work#.</p>
				<h4>PostgreSQL database design and Ground station interface with HTML5/Javascript/php (need to put in html and postgres stuff for chart)</h4>
				<p>I am in charge making changes to each of our flight databases. I have also made an interface with chart.js so anyone on our network can monitor some of our instrument's parameters during a flight. Check out the simplified version below! #put in chart# This is another great part of my job because to a professional degree, I get to show some of my creative side!</p>
